Airbnb (ABNB) is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in specific locales.We have our dataset from Airbnb based on NY and it has 48,895 rows and 16 columns. NY is the most expensive city in the USA. From data we retrieved the basic information to understand the what data is saying, We started from looking out for duplicate values, missing values to get better understand of the data and we found 4 column values are missing. After cleaning the data, we started the Exploratory data analysis to get some insight from the data.
